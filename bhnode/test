herd engine ->
                sable
                s3
                // ddb

if sable fails, herd developers have to do emergency deployment of new code,
    makes all data stored in s3 instead of sable

**
always querying the data storage types to check health
and if health is low or service down, then dynamically switch to other 
storage type gradually
